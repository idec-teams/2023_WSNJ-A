                        Global warming, rising sea levels and continued
                        environmental degradation are all linked to carbon
                        emissions. In China&#39;s total carbon emissions,
                        microbial carbon emissions account for 7%, and most of
                        the carbon emissions generated by microorganisms come
                        from sugar degradation. Carbon sequestration is
                        conducive to reducing carbon emissions, but it also
                        reduces the efficiency of sugar degradation. This
                        project attempts to introduce a highly active
                        phosphoketolase (F/Xpk) gene into the heterotrophic
                        microbial strain Clostridium butyricum L319, to
                        construct an artificial NOG pathway with high metabolic
                        flux. Compared with the native EMP pathway, this
                        alternative pathway metabolizes glucose into acetyl CoA
                        without carbon loss and carbon emissions. The approach
                        used in this project can be further adopted to a variety
                        of strains with similar metabolic carbon emission
                        issues, thereby contributing to the reduction of global
                        carbon emissions.

                        Nowadays overfull carbon emission has become a very
                        serious problem because of its harmful impacts on the
                        global environment. Carbon emission is one of the major
                        causes for global temperature rise together with other
                        greenhouse gas emission. Stemming from the immense
                        burning of fossil fuels and tremendous industrial
                        processes such as cement and steel production, carbon
                        emission has increased rapidly over the past years
                        (Figure 1). It potentially leads to melting glaciers and
                        permafrost layer, sea level rise, saline water
                        intrusion, increasing droughts, floods and ecosystem
                        mutation.

                        Many countries and regions are taking the moves to
                        control carbon emissions. China launches a policy aiming
                        to reach over 1200 GW installed wind and solar power to
                        partially substitute the usage of fossil fuels. US and
                        EU also set up the carbon tariff proposals and
                        legislations, aiming to build new “green trade
                        barriers”. The main measures to reduce emissions include
                        the development of renewable energy, energy conservation
                        and energy recycling. In this project, we focuses on the
                        experimental promotion of microbial carbon sequestration
                        to reduce carbon emission.

                      <p>
                        Microorganisms play a significant role in reducing
                        carbon emissions by sequestering carbon through carbon
                        fixation. There are three main types of carbon fixation:
                        autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic fixation
                        (Figure 2). Autotrophic microorganisms convert CO2 into
                        biomass by deriving energy from light or inorganic
                        electron donors such as H2, H2S, S, NH4+, NO2-, FE2+[1].
                        Heterotrophic microorganisms are not themselves able of
                        carbon fixation but are able to grow by using the carbon
                        fixed by other organisms. Heterotrophs utilize organic
                        carbon sources. For example, methylotrophs use reduced
                        one-carbon compounds like methanol or methane for their
                        growth. Mixotrophic microorganisms combines autotrophic
                        and heterotrophic&nbsp;fixation, using organic carbon as
                        a supplementary carbon and energy source while utilizing
                        light energy to absorb and convert CO2.

                      <p>
                        While some microorganisms can reduce inorganic carbon
                        from our environment by fixation, microorganisms also
                        emit CO2 during respiration in aerobic and/or anaerobic
                        states to gain energy. In China&#39;s total carbon
                        emissions, microbial carbon emissions account for 7%,
                        and most of the carbon emissions generated by
                        microorganisms come from sugar degradation. A study has
                        shown that due to climate change, bacteria can adapt to
                        higher temperatures through enhancing the respiration
                        rate and emitting more CO2 [2]. This could potentially
                        escalate the carbon emission and climate change
                        problems, resulting in a vicious cycle.

                        Clostridium tyrobutyricum is a mesophilic, Gram-positive
                        and heterotrophic bacterium growing under anaerobic

                        microorganism and a novel probiotic. Because of its high
                        yield of butyric acid, its fermentation is widely
                        applied in the fields of fine chemical production and
                        human health [4]. Due to its industrial traits, the
                        control of CO2 emission during the large-scale
                        industrial fermentation of Clostridium tyrobutyricum is

                        One important CO2 emission source of Clostridium
                        tyrobutyricum is the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP)
                        pathway. EMP is a pathway of glycolysis. Glycolysis is
                        an ancient metabolic pathway and an anaerobic energy
                        source in practically all living organisms. In the EMP
                        pathway, glucose breaks down into two three-carbon
                        pyruvates, investing two ATPs and harvesting four ATPs
                        and two NADHs. Each pyruvate is converted to a
                        two-carbon acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl CoA, AcCoA) through
                        oxidative decarboxylation emitting one CO2 molecule
                        (Figure 3). Therefore, for each glucose molecule, two
                        CO2 molecules are released [3]. The enzymatic reactions
                        in this pathway happen in milliseconds. With the large
                        scale of fermentation, the net amount of carbon loss
                        from Clostridium tyrobutyricum is huge. Thus, there is a
                        great significance to reduce carbon emission in the EMP
                        pathway.

                        Non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) pathway is an artificial
                        pathway proposed by Bogorad et al. to address the carbon
                        loss problem in the EMP pathway. NOG pathway breaks down
                        sugars or sugar phosphates into the maximum amount of C2
                        metabolites without carbon loss [5].

                      <p>
                        NOG pathway is a cyclic pathway starts with fructose
                        6-phosphate (F6P) as the input molecule. With two more
                        invested F6P molecules, three F6P molecules split into
                        three acetyl phosphate (AcP) and three erythorse
                        4-phosphate (E4P) molecules by phosphoketolase. The
                        three E4P molecules form two F6P molecules by carbon
                        rearrangement. These two F6P molecules are the invested
                        F6P in the starting step of NOG pathway thus forming the
                        cyclic pathway. As a result, for each NOG cycle, one F6P
                        molecule is converted into three AcP molecules without
                        carbon loss (Figure 4). The three AcP molecules can then
                        be converted to three AcCoA molecules without carbon
                        loss.

                        NOG enables complete carbon conservation in sugar
                        catabolism to acetyl-CoA, and can be integrated with EMP

                        Bogorad first experimented a hybrid of NOG and EMP
                        pathways in E. coli [5]. In the glycolysis of E. coli,
                        glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate which
                        is then rearranged to F6P. Each F6P molecule is
                        converted to two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)
                        molecules. In the EMP pathway, the two G3P molecules
                        eventually convert to two AcCoA molecules and release
                        two CO2 molecules. By adding an alternative NOG pathway,
                        one F6P molecule is converted to three AcP molecules
                        instead of two G3P molecules in the EMP pathway,
                        resulting in producing one more AcCoA molecule without
                        any carbon emission (Figure 4).

                        has been preliminary realized in the auto-trophic
                        carbon-fixing syngas-fermenting Clostridium which proves
                        that the NOG pathway is feasible in Clostridium
                        engineering [9].

                      <p>
                        By comparison, we found that most of the key enzymes in

                        E. Coli [5], natively exist in Clostridium
                        tyrobutyricum. This means Clostridium tyrobutyricum have
                        the fundamental conditions for the construction of the
                        NOG pathway. The functions of the absent key enzymes in

                        To integrate the NOG pathway into the Clostridium
                        tyrobutyricum, we plan to engineer a highly active F/Xpk

                        phosphoketolases. This will be carried out by screening

                        constructing and transferring corresponding plasmids

                      <p>
                        Our approach to reduce carbon emission in microorganisms
                        can be applied to other strains with EMP pathway, or
                        coupled to related pathways such as rGS，MCG. The
                        beneficial effect of the NOG pathway is related to
                        carbon conservation and productivity. NOG can be used in
                        conjunction with CO2 fixation and other one-carbon
                        assimilation pathways to achieve a 100% carbon yield to
                        fuels and industrial chemicals. By using the NOG
                        pathway, it is possible to create carbon conservative
                        and productive systems, which can help reduce the carbon
                        footprint of industrial processes and improve the
                        efficiency of bioproduction.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Overall, the NOG pathway has the potential to provide a
                        more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach
                        to engineering metabolic processes.
