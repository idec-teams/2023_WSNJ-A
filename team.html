                    everything's all fresh and appealing. I'm very much into
                    Biology, especially Molecular Bio, which is partially why I
                    joined the wet lab team. Besides Bio, my enthusiasm also
                    goes to reading novels. Out of academic stuff, I enjoy Ping
                    Pong and video games (now working hard on Zelda). Other
                    media, such as podcast, music, comedy, appears quite
                    fascinating to me, too.

                    myself completely and do what I want to do. In April this
                    year, I joined the iGEM Nanjing-BioX competition group,
